### Me
Hi, I'm Sean and my background is in the simulation and reliability modelling of systems. I have worked previously as a researcher and lecturer in academia and am currently employed as a simulation engineer at [Northvolt](https://northvolt.com/) in Sweden, where we are on a mission to produce the world's greenest batteries. 
### This blog
Here I will write about things that interest me, including:

- applications of simulation and reliability modelling in research, business and industry.
- demos, experiments, reviews and tutorials on open-source and commercial software libraries and tools for simulation and reliability modelling of systems.
- tips, tricks and best practices for running successful modelling projects.
- other random topics.
