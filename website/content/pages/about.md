## Me
I'm a simulation engineer and researcher with over 10 years of experience in industry and academia. I've used a variety of simulation software libraries and tools including [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Plant Simulation](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/), and [JaamSim](https://jaamsim.com/). I've also developed custom simulation software in [Python](https://www.python.org) and [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).

## This blog
This blog is about:

- applications of simulation modelling to understand and optimise complex systems and processes in business and industry.
- demos, experiments, reviews and tutorials on open-source and commercial system and process simulation software libraries and tools.
- data science, machine learning and AI applications in simulation modelling.
- general thoughts, ideas and opinions on simulation modelling.
