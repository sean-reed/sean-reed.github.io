Here you can find some of my favourite simulation software that I have used in the past in various projects.

## Discrete event simulation (DES)
- [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A free and open-source Python library for developing discrete event simulation models. Used widely within academia and also within some big companies, such as at the fashion e-commerce platform [Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/) (see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=693UiPq6mII)) and the online supermarket [Picnic](https://x.com/picnic) (see the [blog post](https://blog.picnic.nl/replicating-a-multi-million-euro-automated-warehouse-in-python-d9a8fdd13ea6)). I love the flexibility and power that building simulations in pure software gives you, in this case Python which means you have a wealth of powerful data science and other useful libraries to integrate with.
 
    The library itself is quite lightweight, mainly comprising of an environment to manage the event queue as well as some basic functions and classes for representing events, processes, and resources. This means you need to implement all your model components and processes from scratch, however with some practice this is not too difficult and means that you can develop exactly what is needed without any fluff. It's also quite efficient in terms of processing events (considering it's written in an interpreted language not known for its speed), so it's certainly possible to build models of large and complex systems that can be simulated in reasonable times if you optimise your model code well. The library is very mature and bug-free at this point and so is updated only infrequently.

- [Plant Simulation](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/): A Windows only commercial visual interactive simulation (VIS) software tool from the German industrial technology heavyweight Siemens that is in mainly used within European manufacturing companies. 
    
    Uses a proprietary programming language called SimTalk (well SimTalk 2.0 since their was also an earlier version that has since been deprecated) that is quite quirky (e.g. case-insensitive) but powerful, one nice feature of the environment is that you can hot fix or modify code in a running or paused simulation which is helps when debugging or experimenting. Since 2024 it has also supported methods written in Python which is a welcome addition. 
    
    The base library that comes with the software includes generic modelling objects to represent commonly used manufacturing equipment like processing stations and conveyors but it is not extensive nor include models of specific real equipment from vendors. However, it is easy to extend these with your own custom logic and 3D graphics to develop realistic and accurate representation of the equipment in the system or process you are modelling. It is heavily object-orientated, meaning your model components can derive from common base classes that implement the shared properties and behaviour and your model instances (i.e. the individual objects representing entities in your model) derive from an object in your library so that you can update all instances in one place (as well as add custom behaviour and properties to each where needed).
    
    The simulation engine itself is very efficient and so fast simulation speeds can be achieved if you avoid some common pitfalls when implementing your models. As with most VIS tools, the built-in statistical analysis and data visualisation capabilities are quite poor however, so I usually use Python for that together with the tools data import/export facilities. It is also remarkably stable, so crashes are thankfully quite rare (unfortunately not always the case for VIS tools), and supports Git version control through an (optional) file format based on a folder of YAML files.

- [JaamSim](https://jaamsim.com/): A relatively new entry in the visual interactive simulation (VIS) software tool space that has the major benefit of being free and open-source (a paid professional version exists with some additonal libraries and customer support). Written in Java and cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux), it is extremely fast compared to the commercial offerings according to [benchmarks performed by the main author](http://jaamsim.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-fastest-simulation-software.html) and has full 3D visualisation capabilities. This is my go to VIS DES software when not working on commercial projects that require or benefit from using Plant Simulation.

- [Simmer](https://r-simmer.org/): A discrete event simulation software library written in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). Based on a novel modelling concept, where the paths entities take during are simulations are implemented as chained process steps (or pipelines) that the author calls trajectories (described in [this paper](doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i02)). I only used this once for a project where I needed to use R to integrate with another library, but it was simple to use (despite my limited experience with R) and the trajectory concept is very interesting.

- [CPN IDE (and the related CPN tools)](https://cpnide.org/): A Coloured Petri Net simulation tools. Coloured Petri nets are a formal modelling language that are useful for modelling complex systems and processes, especially those that involve concurrency and synchronisation, with applications to manufacturing, business processes and computer networks among others.

## Traffic (including multi-modal mobility) simulation
- [SUMO](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/): A free and open-source microscopic multi-modal simulation package (engine and collection of tools) that is supported by the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/) and mainly developed by [Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de/en/ts/). The tool is cross-platform (running on Windows, MacOS, and Linux) and can simulate networks up to the city scale. Very actively developed with regular bug fix and feature updates and an active community of users (there is a user conference held each year). Has a Python interface available, called Traci, which allows granular control and monitoring of a running simulation. 

## Process Mining
- [ProM](https://promtools.org/): A Java based process mining and simulation software. Useful for data mining and modelling of business processes.
